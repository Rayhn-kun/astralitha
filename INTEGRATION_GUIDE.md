# Integration Guide for Manajer Karakter 3D Anime Console App and Web App

This guide explains how to integrate the Python console application with the Flask web application to manage 3D anime character models effectively.

## Overview

- The console app (`XORVEXCIC/console_app.py`) manages character data locally via a list of dictionaries.
- The Flask web app (`app.py` and related templates/static files) provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading, previewing, and downloading 3D models.
- Integration involves sharing data between the console app and web app, typically via a shared database or data file.

## Step-by-Step Integration

### 1. Choose a Shared Data Storage

- Use a lightweight database like SQLite or a JSON file to store character metadata.
- Modify the console app to read/write character data from this shared storage.
- Modify the Flask app to read character data from the same storage and update it on uploads.

### 2. Modify Console App

- Replace the in-memory `karakter_list` with loading data from the shared storage on startup.
- Save changes back to the storage after add/update/delete operations.

### 3. Modify Flask App

- On file upload, save the uploaded file to `uploads/`.
- Update the shared storage with metadata about the new model (name, anime, software, file name, status).
- On page load, read the shared storage to display the list of models.

### 4. Synchronize Data Access

- Ensure both apps use consistent data formats and handle concurrent access safely.
- Consider using file locks or database transactions.

### 5. Deployment

- Deploy both apps on the same server or environment.
- The console app can be used for batch or offline management.
- The web app provides a modern interface for users.

## Additional Recommendations

- Implement API endpoints in Flask for CRUD operations on character data.
- Enhance the console app to interact with these APIs for real-time updates.
- Add authentication and authorization as needed.

## Summary

This integration enables seamless management of 3D anime character models via both console and web interfaces, leveraging shared data storage and consistent data handling.
